# [my 1st site](https://bh1.netlify.app/)

Hello and thanks for looking at my first site! 

It's terrible... but the content is cute :)

This site was created on 07.01.22 during the intro week of my coding bootcamp with Northcoders. At the time, this was the absolute hardest thing to create and I felt things would never make sense... had no idea what was coming next haha

I've decided to host the site to show how much I've progressed in such a small amount of time. And maybe to show off my dog too :)

Thanks for looking!
